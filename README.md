Here, I have compiled (or am currently compiling) notes for MENU Real Analysis, course 321 at
Northwestern University. Big thanks to Jason Siefken for putting together the inital LaTeX templating,
which will be slowly revised as work continues on this project.

I use xelatex for compilation. I have no idea if that will work for you, but it should be as simple as
'xelatex notes.tex'
